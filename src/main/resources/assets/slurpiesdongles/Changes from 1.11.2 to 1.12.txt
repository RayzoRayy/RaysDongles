It's also changed to drop like my Nether Lapis Ore, more than what Vanilla Lapis drops.

Nether Redstone Ore now drops Redstone instead of Nether Redstone Ore. The Redstone drop randomly, similar to Lapis, so each time it'll drop a different ammount. 
It's also changed to drop like my Nether Lapis Ore, more than what Vanilla Lapis drops.

Staff of Time now has a GUIScreen however the mouse cursor at the moment is a little buggy

VMPick now has a durability of 6,200, down from 22,000. This can still be changed in the config if you wish to do so.
